As of late my focus has been on learning ruby. But my true passion is design. I wanted to get back to having fun with what I love. So I worked on this small project to practice my responsive design skills. 

The faces were images taken from a Google search. They were edited and it was definitely a great time getting the sound bites up. 

I'd like to add some cool animation features to this project in the near future.
